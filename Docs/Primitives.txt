Booleans
========
bool is also represented by Number (true = 1, false = 0). 
This simplifies compatibility with CLI operations which does not define a boolean type but instead uses 1 and 0.

Less-than-64-bit ints
=====================
sbyte, byte, char, short, ushort, int and uint are modelled at runtime as JavaScript's Number.
All values are stored as signed and if unsigned operations are needed, values need to be converted. 
E.g. uint.MaxValue is actually stored as -1.

64-bit ints
===========
int64 and uint64 are modelled at runtime as two-element Uint32Array. 
Arithemetic operations are defined in the types System.Int64 and System.UInt64.

Methods
Instance methods of primitives, such as Equals, ToString and GetHashCode are implemented in corlib. 

Number
======

The type CilJs.JavaScript.Number can be used when you want to have access to JavaScript's native Number values.
